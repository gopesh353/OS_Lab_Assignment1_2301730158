Parent: Child for 'Who Am I' has finished.

Parent: All command-executing children have finished.

--- Task 3: Simulating Zombie & Orphan Processes ---

-- Part A: Zombie Process --
  Parent (PID:567): Created child 574, not waiting.
  >> The child is now a zombie. Check with 'ps -el | grep defunct' in another terminal.
  Zombie Child (PID:574): Exiting now.
  Parent: Cleaned up the zombie process.

-- Part B: Orphan Process --
  Parent (PID:567): Exiting before my child.
  Orphan Child (PID:575): My parent is 567.
  Orphan Child: My original parent died. My new parent is 567 (init/systemd).

Parent: Orphan simulation complete.

--- Task 4: Inspecting Process PID 567 from /proc ---
  Name: python3
  State:        R (running)
  VmSize:          15764 kB
  Executable Path: /usr/bin/python3.12
  Open File Descriptors: 4

--- Task 5: Demonstrating Process Prioritization (CPU Overload) ---
  Detected 10 CPU cores. Creating 20 processes to ensure competition.
  Starting a mix of default-priority and low-priority children...
  Default Priority-0 (PID:576, Nice:0): Starting CPU work.
  Low Priority-0 (PID:577, Nice:15): Starting CPU work.

  Low Priority-2 (PID:581, Nice:15): Starting CPU work.
  Default Priority-2 (PID:580, Nice:0): Starting CPU work.
  Default Priority-3 (PID:582, Nice:0): Starting CPU work.
  Default Priority-4 (PID:584, Nice:0): Starting CPU work.
  Low Priority-3 (PID:583, Nice:15): Starting CPU work.
  Low Priority-4 (PID:585, Nice:15): Starting CPU work.
  Default Priority-6 (PID:588, Nice:0): Starting CPU work.
  Default Priority-5 (PID:586, Nice:0): Starting CPU work.
  Low Priority-5 (PID:587, Nice:15): Starting CPU work.
  Low Priority-6 (PID:589, Nice:15): Starting CPU work.
  Default Priority-7 (PID:590, Nice:0): Starting CPU work.
  Low Priority-7 (PID:591, Nice:15): Starting CPU work.
  Default Priority-8 (PID:592, Nice:0): Starting CPU work.
  Default Priority-9 (PID:594, Nice:0): Starting CPU work.
  Low Priority-8 (PID:593, Nice:15): Starting CPU work.
  Low Priority-9 (PID:595, Nice:15): Starting CPU work.
  Default Priority-2: Finished in 12.06 seconds.
  Default Priority-8: Finished in 12.17 seconds.
  Default Priority-6: Finished in 12.45 seconds.
  Default Priority-5: Finished in 12.54 seconds.
  Default Priority-1: Finished in 12.66 seconds.
  Default Priority-9: Finished in 12.63 seconds.
  Default Priority-7: Finished in 12.66 seconds.
  Default Priority-0: Finished in 12.81 seconds.
  Default Priority-4: Finished in 13.26 seconds.
  Default Priority-3: Finished in 13.51 seconds.
  Low Priority-2: Finished in 23.42 seconds.
  Low Priority-4: Finished in 23.41 seconds.
  Low Priority-9: Finished in 23.52 seconds.
  Low Priority-7: Finished in 23.69 seconds.
  Low Priority-8: Finished in 23.85 seconds.
  Low Priority-6: Finished in 23.86 seconds.
  Low Priority-5: Finished in 23.89 seconds.
  Low Priority-0: Finished in 23.95 seconds.
  Low Priority-1: Finished in 23.96 seconds.
  Low Priority-3: Finished in 25.19 seconds.

Parent: All CPU-intensive children have finished.
Observe the finish times: the 'Default Priority' processes should have generally finished earlier than the 'Low Priority' ones.
