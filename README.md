# OS_Lab_Assignment1_2301730158

ðŸ“ŒExperiment Objectives:

In this assignment, students will simulate Linux process management operations using Python. The experiment focuses on replicating the behaviors of fork(), exec(), and process state inspections using the os and subprocess modules in Python. It provides an understanding of process creation, child-parent relationship, and zombie/orphan process scenarios.



# Task 1: Process Creation Utility


Write a Python program that creates N child processes using os.fork(). Each child prints:
- Its PID
- Its Parent PID
- A custom message
The parent should wait for all children using os.wait().

# Task 2: Command Execution Using exec()

Modify Task 1 so that each child process executes a Linux command (ls, date, ps, etc.) using os.execvp() or subprocess.run().

# Task 3: Zombie & Orphan Processes

Zombie: Fork a child and skip wait() in the parent.
Orphan: Parent exits before the child finishes.
Use ps -el | grep defunct to identify zombies.

# Task 4: Inspecting Process Info from /proc

Take a PID as input. Read and print:
- Process name, state, memory usage from /proc/[pid]/status
- Executable path from /proc/[pid]/exe
- Open file descriptors from /proc/[pid]/fd
- 
# Task 5: Process Prioritization

Create multiple CPU-intensive child processes. Assign different nice() values. Observe and log execution order to show scheduler impact.
